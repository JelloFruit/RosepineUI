# RosepineUI
just a modified WizardUI theme using Rosepine's UI.

Nothing special, I just like the colors and look of it. It's not neat at ALL but i'll make some more modifications soon.

# nightTab

you can use this alongside of the discord theme, make sure to configure it to the size of your computer if it looks off.
2 versions, one with blur, and one without (if you want that.)
